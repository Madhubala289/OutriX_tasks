# House Price Prediction

This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various property features using the well-known Kaggle House Prices dataset.

## Project Overview

The goal is to clean the data, perform feature engineering, and train regression models to accurately predict house prices. This notebook demonstrates using Linear Regression and Random Forest models.

## Dataset

- The dataset used is the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset from Kaggle.
- It contains residential home sales data with features like size, location, year built, number of rooms, and more.

## Features

- Data cleaning by handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Training and evaluating Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor models.
- Visualizing model predictions and feature importance.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## How to Use

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place `train.csv` in the project folder.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `notebook.ipynb` step by step.
3. Observe data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.

## Results

- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and RÂ² score for both models are calculated.
- Random Forest typically outperforms Linear Regression in this project.
- Visualizations show the predicted vs actual prices and important features influencing the prices.
Feel free to explore, modify, and improve the model for better accuracy!
