# ðŸŽ¬Sentiment Analysis for movie review

This project classifies **movie reviews** as **Positive** or **Negative** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.  
It uses the **NLTK Movie Reviews dataset** and compares two models:  
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Logistic Regression**

The better-performing model is saved and used in a **Streamlit web app** for live predictions.
